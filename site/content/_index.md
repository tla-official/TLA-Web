      Coding is the first topic to appear on our channel. It is the most
      interesting field which is very useful because coding is everywhere for
      example - for the robots to function we need coding.

      The topics we started under coding is p5*JS and Python.

      The second topic to arrive at is Maths or Mathematics. This is very
      interesting for some students and it is very problematic for some. 

      So, to fix this issue we are here. We might not be able to answer some higher topics in this subject because we are kids who are running this ( Kids means not like 2 or 3 year old, We are between kids and teens ).

    text: Then Science is the next subject which in hopped into our family, a friend
      of ours was very interested in science and wanted to spread what he knew.
      Like this came our 3rd subject.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
